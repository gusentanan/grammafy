I kept using ChatGPT to correct grammar in my messages (working with foreigners does that), but I hated copy-pasting and sifting through replies. So I built Grammafy. <br/><br/> It uses Google Gemini to correct grammar, tone, and clarity—no need to switch apps. You can auto-paste from a template, submit it, and copy the fixed result instantly. <br/><br/> That’s all for now. </p> </td> </tr> </table>

## More About
```
I haven't programmed this app to collect any personal information.

However, since you're using your own Gemini API key,  
all your prompts and responses are processed by your Google Cloud account.

On your device, no data is stored permanently.  
You can delete all local data by clearing the app’s storage or uninstalling it
