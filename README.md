        <p> 
   This app was a byproduct of my long weekend last month. I found myself using ChatGPT a lot to correct my messages since I'm working with foreigners, but I hated typing them out and manually selecting ChatGPT's responses. Since we don’t need a super-advanced model just for grammar correction, Gemini is more than enough—though I’m just using the free trial, which works fine for me (you should give it a try too!).
This app lets you auto-paste your template text if you feel it’s not good enough (there’s a button for that), and once the corrected response is given, you can easily copy it. That’s all for now, lol.

## More About
```
I haven't programmed this app to collect any personal information.  
However, since you're using your own API key,  
**all your conversations are stored in your Google Cloud console.**  

On your device, no data is stored permanently,  
and you can easily delete any local data by clearing the app's storage or uninstalling it.

```
More about it later ..
